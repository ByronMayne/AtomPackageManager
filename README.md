# Atom Package Manager


Atom is a libaray used to manage external libraries in Unity. The over all goal of Atom is the following.
* Download source from external sources (git currently).
* Compile source and insert result into Unity.
* Allow for custom defines and using the ones already defined in Unity.
* Customization of output per project.
* Handle dependencies.
* External's CS projects are added to the Unity solution. 
* Selective files to include, no need to compile the whole source if you only need part of it. 

Right now in active development.
